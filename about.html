    <h4 id="scrollspyHeading1">College History</h4>
    <p>St. Joseph - Patron<br>
St. Joseph's College is an affiliated First Grade College of the Bharathidasan University. It was established in 1844 by the Fathers of Society of Jesus (The Jesuits). It was affiliated to the then Madras University in 1866. The College celebrated its centenary in 1944 and sesquicentenary in 1995. The College is owned by the Society of St. Joseph's, a body registered under Societies Regulation Act(1860), having its office at Tiruchirappalli. This Jesuit College trains young men and women of quality to be leaders in all walks of life so that they may serve the people of the nation in truth, justice and love.</p>
    <h4 id="scrollspyHeading2">College Motto</h4>
    <p>True to its noble ideal,<br>
<strong>"Ero Bono Et Vero"</strong><br>
(for the Good and the True), the St. Joseph's College has always upheld and radiated Goodness and Truth in its endeavour to impart quality in higher education. This educational establishment has been instrumental in churning out thousands of truly educated persons, physically fit and intellectually well equipped. Thus, this College stands for what is best in education.
The College blazon is a distinctive badge expressing its aim and ideal. It bears azure, with Tiruchirappalli Rock and College Church for distinctive features. The conspicuous Palm Tree in the middle is the Emblem of the East. It bears in fesse, a bow, and above it is the monogram of the Society of Jesus. Its crest is a royal crown and a lily issuant, both in honour of the college Patron, St. Joseph, the crown to signify that he was of David's royal blood, and the lily to signify his spotless purity. Thus the whole in ordinary language would read: The College of St. Joseph conducted by the Members of the Society of Jesus at Tiruchirappalli in the East.</p>
